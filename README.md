# BASIC

BASIC for .NET

Going to build a BASIC compiler for .NET using VB.NET on .NET Core (currently targeting 3.0).

## Credits

Although not the same compiler, the process of building this compiler is inspired in part by [Minsk by Immo Landwerth (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHIkdUQbp0&list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y).  If you are interested in how to build a C-style compiler for .NET, please see his [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHIkdUQbp0&list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y).  Some key differences are:

- A language similar to BASIC instead of C/JScript.
- Using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition (instead of Visual Studio Code).
- Using GitHub Tools for Visual Studio instead of command line tools.

I highly recommend [Immo's video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgHIkdUQbp0&list=PLRAdsfhKI4OWNOSfS7EUu5GRAVmze1t2y)... it's awesome!

One additional note is that although not inspired by the comment he has at about 11 minutes into his first video, this project does attempt to answer the request someone made in his first live stream. ;-)
